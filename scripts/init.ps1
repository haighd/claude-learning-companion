# Golden Rules

These are the most validated and critical heuristics - promoted from the general pool after proving their value repeatedly.

---

## Rule 1: Make It Work, Then Make It Right

**Confidence**: 0.9
**Source**: observation
**Domain**: architecture

First focus on getting a working solution, even if imperfect. Then refactor and optimize. Trying to build the perfect architecture from the start often leads to analysis paralysis.

**Validated**: Proven across multiple projects
**Violations**: Premature optimization often causes delays

---

## Rule 2: Explicit is Better Than Implicit

**Confidence**: 0.95
**Source**: failure
**Domain**: coordination

When coordinating between agents, explicit communication of intent, state, and expectations prevents misunderstandings. Hidden assumptions are the enemy of reliable systems.

**Validated**: Critical for agent coordination
**Violations**: Implicit assumptions cause cascading failures

---

## Rule 3: Fail Fast, Learn Faster

**Confidence**: 0.85
**Source**: observation
**Domain**: debugging

Design systems to fail quickly and obviously rather than silently degrading. Fast feedback loops accelerate learning.

**Validated**: Speeds up debugging cycles
**Violations**: Silent failures waste time

---

## Rule 4: Document Decisions, Not Just Code

**Confidence**: 0.9
**Source**: success
**Domain**: coordination

Record the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what". Future you (or future agents) will thank you.

**Validated**: Prevents repeated mistakes
**Violations**: Forgotten context leads to regression

---

*These rules are living documents. As we learn more, they evolve.*

# Claude Learning Companion

A systematic approach to learning from failures, extracting heuristics, and running deliberate experiments.

## Quick Start

### Initialize the Framework

``````bash
./scripts/init.sh         # Bash
./scripts/init.ps1        # PowerShell
``````

### Record a Failure

``````bash
./scripts/record-failure.sh      # Bash
./scripts/record-failure.ps1     # PowerShell
``````

### Record a Heuristic

``````bash
./scripts/record-heuristic.sh    # Bash
./scripts/record-heuristic.ps1   # PowerShell
``````

### Start an Experiment

``````bash
./scripts/start-experiment.sh    # Bash
./scripts/start-experiment.ps1   # PowerShell
``````

## Philosophy

1. **Fail Deliberately**: Create controlled experiments to test assumptions
2. **Extract Patterns**: Convert experiences into reusable heuristics
3. **Validate Continuously**: Track which rules prove helpful vs harmful
4. **Promote the Best**: Elevate proven heuristics to golden rules
5. **Stay Humble**: All knowledge is provisional and subject to revision

## The Learning Loop

``````
Try → Break → Analyze → Extract → Validate → Promote
``````

Every cycle adds to our collective intelligence.
