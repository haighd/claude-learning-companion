# Step 3: Analyze Evidence

## Objective
Transform raw evidence into synthesized findings by identifying patterns, contradictions, and insights.

## Instructions

### 1. Pattern Recognition

Review all collected evidence and identify:

**Recurring Themes:**
- What concepts appear across multiple sources?
- What terminology is consistently used?
- What assumptions are shared?

**Contradictions:**
- Where do sources disagree?
- What explanations exist for contradictions?
- Which position has stronger evidence?

**Gaps:**
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What assumptions are untested?
- What would change conclusions if known?

### 2. Apply Agent Perspectives

Analyze through ELF agent lenses:

**Researcher Perspective:**
- What does the evidence definitively support?
- What claims lack sufficient backing?
- What additional research would strengthen findings?

**Architect Perspective:**
- How do findings fit into larger systems?
- What dependencies exist?
- What are the structural implications?

**Skeptic Perspective:**
- What could go wrong if we act on these findings?
- What edge cases weren't considered?
- What's the worst-case interpretation?

**Creative Perspective:**
- What novel connections emerge?
- What unconventional approaches might work?
- What assumptions could be challenged?

### 3. Confidence Assessment

Rate overall confidence in findings:

| Aspect | Confidence | Reasoning |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Core findings | high/medium/low | [why] |
| Supporting details | high/medium/low | [why] |
| Recommendations | high/medium/low | [why] |

### 4. Formulate Key Findings

Distill analysis into 3-5 key findings:

**Finding Template:**
```markdown
### Finding [N]: [Title]

**Statement:** [Clear, specific claim]

**Supporting Evidence:**
- [Evidence 1]
- [Evidence 2]

**Confidence:** [high/medium/low]

**Caveats:** [Limitations or conditions]
```
