   - Result: `ok` ✓
   - Status: Database is not corrupted

2. **Total Records in Database**
   - Count: 160 records
   - Status: All previous records intact

3. **Stress Test Records**
   - Expected: 10 records (one per concurrent process)
   - Actual: 10 records ✓
   - Domain: 'testing'
   - Title Pattern: 'Stress Test Failure %'

4. **Record ID Range**
   - First ID: 301
   - Last ID: 310
   - Sequential Range: Consecutive with no gaps ✓

5. **Sample Records Inserted**
   ```
   ID  | Domain  | Title                  | Severity | Created At
   ----+---------+------------------------+----------+-------------------
   310 | testing | Stress Test Failure 9  |    3     | 2025-12-02 02:45:57
   309 | testing | Stress Test Failure 8  |    3     | 2025-12-02 02:45:57
   308 | testing | Stress Test Failure 10 |    3     | 2025-12-02 02:45:57

   306 | testing | Stress Test Failure 6  |    3     | 2025-12-02 02:45:57
   ```

6. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Result: No duplicates found ✓
   - All 10 records are unique

**Status:** PASS - Database integrity verified, all 10 records successfully stored with no corruption.

## Test 3: Git Lock Status Verification

### Lock File Detection

1. **Git Directory Lock Files**
   - Pattern: `*.lock` in `.git/`
   - Result: **NONE FOUND** ✓
   - Status: No stale .lock files

2. **Mkdir-based Lock Directories**
   - Pattern: `*.lock.dir` anywhere in framework
   - Result: **NONE FOUND** ✓
   - Status: No orphaned lock directories

3. **Running Processes**
   - Pattern: `record-failure.sh` processes
   - Result: **NONE RUNNING** ✓
   - Status: Clean process list

### Git Repository Status

1. **Repository Health**
   - Status: On branch `master`
   - HEAD: `3a6079aa6b2ce521a336e6f0ac9c614f9ed4d8d4`
   - Accessible: ✓

2. **Index File**
   - Path: `.git/index`
   - Size: 63K
   - Status: Valid and accessible ✓

3. **Recent Commits (Last 5)**
   ```
   3a6079a failure: RED TEXT
   24e41b2 failure: Stress Test Failure 4
   21f4d92 failure: Stress Test Failure 5
   baa5926 failure: Stress Test Failure 7

## Technical Analysis

### Lock Mechanism Implementation

The fix uses a platform-aware locking strategy:

**On Linux/macOS (with `flock`):**
- Uses advisory file locks via `flock` command
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Non-blocking on timeout, returns error

**On Windows/MSYS (without `flock`):**
- Falls back to `mkdir`-based atomic locking
- Leverages POSIX atomic directory creation
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Polls every 1 second

### Why the Fix Works

1. **Atomic Operations**: `mkdir` is atomic at the filesystem level
2. **No Cleanup Race Conditions**: Lock is released immediately after critical section
3. **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents indefinite hangs
4. **Process Isolation**: Each process gets its own atomic lock acquire/release cycle
5. **No Cleanup Needed**: No stale cleanup jobs required

### Evidence of Success

- 10 concurrent processes competed for the same lock
- All 10 succeeded in recording their data
- Database shows all 10 unique records
- No lock files left behind
- No process hangs or timeouts
- No data corruption

## Conclusion

**The git lock contention fix is WORKING CORRECTLY.**

- **Success Count:** 10/10 (100%)
- **Failure Count:** 0/10 (0%)
- **Data Loss:** 0 records
- **Stale Locks:** 0 locks
- **Database Corruption:** None detected

The fix successfully prevents race conditions in concurrent database and git operations without introducing deadlocks, stale locks, or data corruption.

**Recommendation:** FIX IS PRODUCTION-READY
