**Results:**
- ✓ Created backup directory: `20251201_175802`
- ✓ Exported index.db (247 lines SQL, 155,648 bytes binary)
- ✓ Exported vectors.db (39 lines SQL, 397,312 bytes binary)
- ✓ Created git archive of tracked files
- ✓ Generated metadata file
- ✓ Calculated checksums
- ✓ Compressed to tar.gz (674,829 bytes)
- ✓ Verified archive integrity
- ✓ Applied retention policy

**Status:** PASS

### Test 2: Backup Extraction
**Command:** Manual extraction test

**Results:**
- ✓ Archive extracted successfully
- ✓ All files present:
  - index.db (155,648 bytes)
  - vectors.db (397,312 bytes)
  - index.sql (34,047 bytes)
  - vectors.sql (359,861 bytes)
  - backup_metadata.txt
  - checksums.md5
  - All git-tracked files and directories
- ✓ Directory structure preserved

**Status:** PASS

### Test 3: Database Integrity
**Commands:**
```bash
sqlite3 index.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 vectors.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

**Results:**
- ✓ index.db: OK
- ✓ vectors.db: OK
- Both databases passed integrity checks

**Status:** PASS

### Test 4: SQL Restore
**Command:**
```bash
sqlite3 test_index.db < index.sql
sqlite3 test_index.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learnings;"
```

**Results:**
- ✓ SQL import successful
- ✓ Database integrity: OK
- ✓ Data verified: 62 learnings records
- SQL dump restore working correctly

**Status:** PASS

### Test 5: Git-Based Restore
**Command:** `./scripts/restore-from-git.sh list`

**Results:**
- ✓ Listed recent commits correctly
- ✓ Showed commit hashes, messages, graph
- ✓ Dry-run mode works
- ✓ Detected uncommitted changes
- ✓ Prevents data loss by requiring confirmation

**Status:** PASS

### Test 6: Backup Listing
**Command:** `./scripts/restore.sh list`

**Results:**
- ✓ Listed available backups
- ✓ Showed timestamps and sizes
- Note: bc command not available on Windows (minor formatting issue)

**Status:** PASS (with minor cosmetic issue)

---

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### 1. bc Command Not Available (Windows)
**Issue:** `bc` command used for floating-point math not available on Windows Git Bash

**Impact:** Minor - size display formatting in bytes instead of MB

**Workaround:** Created `backup-helpers.sh` with awk-based alternatives

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic issue only)

### 2. md5sum Format Differences
**Issue:** macOS uses `md5` while Linux uses `md5sum`, different output formats

**Impact:** Medium - checksum verification may fail on different platforms

**Workaround:** Restore scripts continue even if checksum verification fails; primary verification is database integrity check

**Priority:** Medium (doesn't prevent restore)

### 3. Date Command Platform Differences
**Issue:** Different flags for date command on macOS vs Linux

**Impact:** Low - age calculation may fail on some platforms

**Workaround:** Scripts try multiple date command formats with fallbacks

**Priority:** Low (doesn't affect core functionality)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✓ All scripts created and tested
2. ✓ Documentation complete
3. ✓ Basic testing performed

### Next Steps
1. Set up automated daily backups via cron
2. Configure remote backup destination
3. Run weekly verification with `verify-backup.sh`
4. Perform quarterly disaster recovery drills
5. Monitor backup logs for failures

### Automation Setup

**Daily Backup (2 AM):**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add:
0 2 * * * ~/.claude/clc/scripts/backup.sh >> ~/.claude/backups/backup.log 2>&1
```

**Weekly Verification (Sunday 3 AM):**
```bash
0 3 * * 0 ~/.claude/clc/scripts/verify-backup.sh --alert-on-fail
```

### Remote Backup Configuration

**Option 1 - rsync:**
```bash
export REMOTE_BACKUP_DEST="user@backup-server:/backups/clc"
```

**Option 2 - rclone (cloud):**
```bash
export REMOTE_BACKUP_DEST="remote:clc-backups"
```

## Recovery Scenarios Covered

The system handles these failure modes:

1. **Corrupted Database** - Restore from SQL or binary backup
2. **Accidental File Deletion** - Git restore or full backup restore
3. **Bad Update** - Git-based rollback with optional database restore
4. **Complete System Loss** - Full restoration from backup
5. **Backup Corruption** - Find most recent valid backup
6. **Data Inconsistency** - Sync or restore from backup
7. **Partial Corruption** - Manual export/import or backup restore
8. **Wrong Restore** - Safety backup allows undo
