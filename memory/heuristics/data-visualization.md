## H-17: Never use pie charts - they fail to show scale and are a waste of ink. Use time series, bar charts, or tables instead.

**Confidence**: 1.0
**Source**: observation
**Created**: 2025-12-26

**Explanation**: Pie charts are ineffective for data visualization because: (1) humans are poor at comparing angles and areas, (2) they cannot show scale or absolute values, (3) they consume significant chart space for minimal information density. Time series charts, bar charts, or tables communicate the same information more accurately and efficiently. This follows Edward Tufte's data-ink ratio principle - maximize data, minimize ink.
