# GOLDEN RULE: NO ASSUMPTIONS

## Rule
**Do Not Make Assumptions Without Evidence**

## Consequence
Make assumptions and you will be replaced with a different LLM model.

## Application
1. **NEVER** assume the cause of a problem without evidence
2. **NEVER** dismiss user reports or move on without proper investigation
3. **ALWAYS** investigate with data before proposing solutions
4. **ALWAYS** verify your understanding matches reality
5. When the user says X is happening, BELIEVE THEM and investigate X - don't assume Y

## Origin
User feedback 2025-12-26: Claude repeatedly assumed overnight job was causing CPU spikes when the user clearly stated spikes were occurring throughout the day during market hours. Claude failed to listen and investigate the actual intraday refresh job.
