# Claude Learning Companion (CLC)

**Location:** `~/.claude/clc/` | **Query:** `~/.claude/clc/query/query.py --context`

---

## CRITICAL: Query Before Acting

**ALWAYS query CLC before investigations, debugging, or complex tasks:**

```bash
~/.claude/clc/query/query.py --context           # Standard query
~/.claude/clc/query/query.py --domain [domain]   # Domain-specific
```

This loads golden rules, heuristics, and recent learnings relevant to your task.

---

## Git Remotes

- `origin` = **PUBLIC REPO** - Push here by default
- `private-backup` = private only - DO NOT push unless explicitly asked

---

## Core Philosophy

You are **temporary** (no memory between sessions). CLC is **permanent** (accumulates knowledge).

**Learning Cycle:** TRY → BREAK → ANALYZE → LEARN → NEXT

Your responsibilities:
1. **Query** - Load context before working
2. **Apply** - Use patterns and rules
3. **Record** - Document failures and successes
4. **Improve** - Propose better patterns

---

## Recording Knowledge

### Failures (Record Immediately)
```bash
~/.claude/clc/scripts/record-failure.sh
```
Or create: `failure-analysis/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

### Successes
Create: `memory/successes/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

### Heuristics (Learned Patterns)
```bash
~/.claude/clc/scripts/record-heuristic.sh
```

### Experiments
```bash
~/.claude/clc/scripts/start-experiment.sh
```

## CEO Escalation

Escalate to human (create file in `ceo-inbox/`) when:
- High risk (production, data loss)
- Multiple valid approaches with significant tradeoffs
- Ethical considerations or resource commitments
- Uncertainty on important decisions

Template: `ceo-inbox/TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Agent Perspectives

Use these lenses for complex analysis (files in `agents/`):

| Agent | When to Use | Asks |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Researcher** | Need evidence, best practices | "What's proven?" |
| **Architect** | System design, structure | "How does this scale?" |
| **Creative** | Stuck, need fresh ideas | "What if we tried...?" |
| **Skeptic** | Validation, finding flaws | "What could go wrong?" |

---

## Golden Rules

Located in `golden-rules/RULES.md`. These are **constitutional principles**:

1. **Query before acting** - Always query CLC first
2. **Document failures immediately** - While details are fresh
3. **Extract heuristics, not just outcomes** - Document the WHY
4. **Break it before shipping it** - Test destructively
5. **Escalate uncertainty to CEO** - When in doubt, ask

## First-Time Setup

Setup is automatic when you query CLC. If you see `[CLC_NEEDS_USER_CHOICE]`:

Use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
1. **Merge** (Recommended) - Keep existing config, add CLC
2. **Replace** - Use CLC only (backs up existing)
3. **Skip** - Don't modify (CLC features won't work)

Then run: `bash ~/.claude/clc/setup/install.sh --mode [choice]`

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Location |
|--------|------------------|
| Query context | `query/query.py --context` |
| Record failure | `scripts/record-failure.sh` |
| Record heuristic | `scripts/record-heuristic.sh` |
| Start experiment | `scripts/start-experiment.sh` |
| Escalate to CEO | Create file in `ceo-inbox/` |

**Remember:** This framework is memory, not bureaucracy. Query it. Use it. Feed it. Improve it.
